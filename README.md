Sentiment Analysis - IMDB Movie Reviews 

This repository uses Keras to create a binary classification deep learning model. The model is trained on Kaggle's IMDB movie review and classifies the reviews as either positive or negative. The model acts as server code with communicates client code using anvil-uplink

Software used: 
- Keras: training the model
- Google Colab: editor, good GPU runtime
- Anvil: client UI in python

Future Improvements:
- Update UI
- Allow users to upload a file with reviews and client returns a csv with classified reviews. This will be useful for businesses who are analysis their user/customer satisfication
- Update model to include negations (not, nor, never). Model currently uses stopwords libabry which removes negotions
